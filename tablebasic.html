            <center><h1>HTML</h1></center>
            <p>It was in 1999 with the HTML 4 standard that the markup language started to concern itself not only with providing information but how the presentation of that information should look. This was when websites got some style. The style was defined within each element in the HTML. In fact, it wasn’t until the HTML 5 standard where we saw the complete separation of concern. Thus, HTML defines the structure of a website, while the concern of formatting was given to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). But don’t worry, you still have some formatting options in HTML 5.</p>

        <center><h1>CSS</h1></center>
        <p>Håkon Wium Lie proposed CSS for the first time on October 10, 1994. But it wasn’t until 1996 when Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer would incorporate CSS into its new browser version. Of course, IE didn’t support all of the properties of CSS, for example, boxes. A couple of months later Netscape came out with its new version of the Netscape Navigator, which supported even more properties.</p>
